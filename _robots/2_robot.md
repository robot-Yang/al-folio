I like wheel-legged robots, I really want to build one by myself or buy one in the future.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robots/ascento_1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robots/ascento_2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robots/diablo.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-5 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robots/skateo.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-5 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robots/handle.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

I think wheel-legged robots achieve a good balance between functionality and complexity.

This is the robot I have been working on in recent two years. 

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robots/qolo_real_life.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robots/qolo_sitting.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

It is a personal mobility device designed for lower-body impaired people, 
the user can transit from sitting to standing and standing to sitting easiliy by him or herslef through a passive exoskelotion limb.

I developed a torso control interface which enables the user to control the locomotion of the device through natural upper body movement. A demo is shon in the video below.

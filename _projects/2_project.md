    Problem definition of wheelchair docking: Case 1 is the case of docking to a pose that faces to the object, and case 2 is the case of docking to the side of the object.

This works {% cite docking %} proposes an autonomous docking support approach for assistive mobility devices like intelligent wheelchairs to assists the user in approaching a rest surface, such as a chair or bed. A virtual landmark estimation method was proposed to extract the target pose from a chair through point cloud processing without any additional landmark. A stable nonlinear feedback controller is designed for the pose alignment task under the constraint of cameraâ€™s field of view (FOV). The effectiveness of the proposed system was demonstrated with a real-time implementation on a standing mobility vehicle.

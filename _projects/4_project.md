To realize a new type of personal mobility device with more flexibility, we proposed a novel concept of a personal mobility device design {% cite wemo %} that combines the agile mobility of a wheel type mechanism but does not limit a human’s natural stair climbing ability. In this work, we introduced a compact personal mobility device, namely WeMo, under the concept of “wearing mobility”, which extends humans’ mobility in daily life. The developed hardware realizes “walking mode” and “driving mode”. Users can move with the motorized driven wheels of the device during driving mode, and users can walk on their feet without any interference from the device during walking mode.

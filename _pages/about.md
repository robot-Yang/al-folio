I am a robotics researcher and life-long learner. I obtained Ph. D. degree in human informatics from University of Tsukuba in March 2023 and currently working as a post-doc at University of Tsukuba. I was a visiting post-doc at ETH Zurich from June 2023 to December 2023 and research fellow (PD) of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) from April 2023 to MArch 2024. My research interests include but are not limited to human augmentation, human-robot interaction, mobile robotics, teleoperation, human sensing, assistive technology, etc.  
Research goal: Use robotics technology to empower humans.
